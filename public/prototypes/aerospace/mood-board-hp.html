    <h2 class="utility_h2">Branding Notes</h2>
    <p class="utility__p">From a base perspective, there are some features of the <em>July 2017 Brand Standards</em> that will need to be optimized and adjusted for digital application: <br><br>1. <strong>Font Sizes:</strong> <br>The brand guide does not specifically mention font sizes, however the general layout of the document leans towards a compact typographic aesthetic. As we (TAG) look at applying these styles to digital screens, we pay close attention to legibility not only for Windows PC* users, but all devices, including iPhones and laptops. We do this by ensuring copy is legible in all scenarios. Since Helvetica—especially Helvetica Neue Condensed—is a very compressed font family, we recommend a base of 20px (at its smallest) for any copy that must be readily recognized by the users. <br><br>*Windows OS does not render small, light-weight fonts very clearly due to the limitations of ClearType. Since 55% of users are accessing the site via Windows machines, we must consider that when styling. <br><br>2. <strong>Font Selection:</strong> <br>Minion Pro is provisioned for web font usage through Typekit, but Helvetica Neue LT is not.** That said, there are alternatives to Helvetica Neue LT that we recommend. <br><br>The first, Nimbus Sans (created by URW++ and provisioned through Typekit as well) was specifically produced to work in place of Helvetica Neue. In fact, Nimbus Sans was built with Helvetica Neue glyphs, and addresses many of the digital-specific pain points that Helvetica Neue has. <br><br>The second option, Oswald, was initially redrawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald, like Nimbus Sans, provides a digital-friendly facsimile of Helvetica Neue and is available using a web font service, which dramatically optimizes font delivery, security, and usage across browsers. <br><br>**Helvetica Neue LT Std is provisioned through another service via MyFonts.com or directly through Linotype. That said, both of these options would require hosting the font <em>on</em> the Aerospace server. Typekit is a subscription based service and priced by number of pageviews per month. For a virtually unlimited number of sites and font families, the cost comes to approximately $50/annually.<br><br><strong>3. Accessibility Notes:</strong> <br>Given that Aerospace is an FFDC, the TAG team will design with Section 508 in mind—ensuring all interactive elements and text are accessible by everyone. To list a few basic rules: links need to be obvious, text must be readable by screen readers (not burned into an image), and colors cannot be the sole indicator of a concept/interaction. Reviewing these elements is a part of our style definition phase, and will be completed once we are decided on a theme concept and can completely define rules within the prototype(s).</p>
